    This differs from the "get a post" call in that it will return the following additional information:

      * A minimal user object
      * A topic object
      * A category object
      * Post content is run through the parser

  parameters:
    - in: path
      name: pid
      schema:
        type: string
      required: true
      description: a valid post id
